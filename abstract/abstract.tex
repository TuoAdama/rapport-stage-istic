	Faced with an obsolete system based on a complex architecture, ONEMART
	found its productivity altered by the fact of the non-automation of the tasks it was carrying out.
	It is in this perspective that the internship of our Master's thesis took place. In fact, throughout this
	throughout this training course we had to put a Web application of transfers and recovery of ar-
	gent to a range of customer (also called intermediary) according to a given method of payment (Credit,
	cash, bank, etc ...). Once the operation (transfer or recovery) is done, thanks to the
	interoperability provided by the application, an external system (also called validator)
	retrieves the information of the operation and validates it thanks to a USSD syntax.
	Thus, in order to frame the development of our application and to meet the requirements of the company, we
	In order to frame the development of our application and to meet the requirements of the company, we have elaborated a design plan thanks to the various UML diagrams. Given the
	functionalities offered by the application, it was developed using the Laravel framework and other
	other development tools (the relational database management system MySQL ,
	a JavaScript library AlpineJs, etc. ...) to facilitate the development of the application while
	while ensuring a good security of this one.\\
