This report describes my internship experience at Orange Business Nantes, a subsidiary of the Orange Group and a major player in the technology sector. During this three-month period, I had the opportunity to work in the software development department, where I was involved in the design, development and implementation of a new application to display code quality reports for the company's projects.\\

This report describes in detail the missions and responsibilities entrusted to me, highlighting the technical and cross-disciplinary skills I developed during this experience. My main responsibilities included working with a multi-disciplinary team to define application specifications, program key functionalities, carry out rigorous testing and help resolve technical issues.\\

The internship enabled me to strengthen my programming skills, particularly in PHP and JavaScript, as well as using frameworks such as React for frontend development and Symfony for the backend. In addition, I have acquired a thorough understanding of agile development methodologies and the importance of communication within a project team.
Beyond the technical aspect, I also had the opportunity to discover the workings of a high-tech company, understanding project management processes, customer interactions and deadline constraints. This experience greatly contributed to my professional development and gave me a concrete perspective of the world of work
